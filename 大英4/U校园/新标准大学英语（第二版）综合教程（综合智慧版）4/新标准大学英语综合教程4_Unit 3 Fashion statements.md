> 01、Comfort is the number one consideration for me, and then cost. I'm a practical person, and I don't really care how I look. I'm the total opposite. I take a lot of pride in being stylish and adopting the latest fashions. I carefully match colours and materials when choosing an outfit.
> 
> 02、I don't have any T-shirts with slogans on, but my uncle used to wear an "I'm with stupid" T-shirt. My aunt would refuse to walk with him! I quite often see Internet memes on T-shirts now, but I don't get most of them. I have a T-shirt with the slogan "Love each other" on it. I've had it for years, and it seems a little immature now.

#### Translatio-1

> 01、1960至2010年间的时装史存在两个不可忽略或不可低估的不变因素：一是无处不在的牛仔裤，二是女装裙摆长度的变化。牛仔裤是用粗斜纹布做的，早在16世纪末法国就有了这种布料。从20世纪50年代后期开始，美国年轻人对牛仔裤趋之若鹜，视其为年轻随意的生活方式的象征。经过嬉皮士时代、朋克时代的洗礼以及经济起伏波荡的影响，牛仔裤经久不衰，不仅被融入了不同的款式、颜色与面料，而且一直被视为是时尚文化一部分。至于第二个不变因素，人们时常会注意到，女人的裙摆和经济之间也存在一种颇为精确的关联性，且鲜有例外。股市升时裙摆也跟着提高；股市跌时裙摆就跟着降低。在经济繁荣和萧条时期女性到底为什么要多暴露或少暴露双腿至今仍然是个谜。

#### Translatio-2

> 01、There is a need to standardize the clothing industry in China. There should be more innovations in Chinese fashion design. Chinese elements in fashion design should have their own brands. While we are trying our best to transcend Western fashion styles, we should also try to break through the traditional Eastern concepts, eventually creating a style that can be called Chinese. Such a Chinese style neither caters to Western fashion tastes nor simply utilizes pure Chinese elements to achieve a national renaissance. Rather, this style features an organic combination of various Eastern elements, skillfully infused at the same time with the features of Western clothes. It is a merging of traditional Chinese culture and multiple world cultures.

> 
> 04、Perhaps the three greatest changes have been the gradual phasing out of traditional dress: the uniformity of blue, black or grey suits, the adoption and influence of Western styles of clothing with bright colours and more individual garments, and recently new ideas in fashion which blend traditional themes with modern ideas.
> 
> 05、I prefer to wear different clothes for different situations because the clothes I wear affect how I feel as well as how I look. I would wear different clothes for an interview compared to those when going on a shopping trip or visiting my grandparents.

#### Writing task-5

> 01、Over the past 60 years, garments in China have become brighter, with a more complex range of colours and styles, and fashions have become more personalized choices as the economy develops and people seek to express their individualism through the clothes they wear. In the 1950s and 1960s, traditional garments and Western styles were often set aside, and Soviet styles were influential for a time. The fashions during this period were to wear Sun Yat-sen-style suits in plain blue, black or grey for men, while women's clothes came in simple modest styles. Most clothes were hand-made by tailors or made at home. During the period of the Cultural Revolution, military uniforms were popular. Few people wore jewellery, but wearing badges of Chairman Mao was normal. As China's economy improved in the 1980s, red and yellow became popular colours for women, and men wore Western suits or jackets and trousers. Ready-made clothes became common, often altered by local tailors. The 1990s saw dramatic changes as people felt that they could dress distinctively: Wider ranges of ready-made clothes were available and people began to follow the fashions of international brands. Some Chinese designers remained anonymous because many garments were produced by large state-run enterprises or joint-venture companies. Nowadays, there is great diversity in fashion trends across China, and Chinese fashion designers meet consumer demands which are raised through the influence of fashion, celebrities and the media. There are now many young entrepreneurial designers in China who sell direct to customers or you can find their garments, with their own labels, in department stores and boutiques. Their designs combine the use of traditional themes and styles with modern materials and innovations. China has become the world's largest manufacturer of clothing and also the largest consumer. In large urban department stores and small boutiques and shops there is a huge range of high-end fashion garments and also of inexpensive clothes. As China exports many garments, we might speculate that Chinese fashion designers and Chinese fashion themes both traditional and modern will have a significant influence on what the world wears in coming years.

#### Exercise-4

> 01、The history of Chinese hairstyles very much reflects the changing of Chinese culture. Confucius once said, "We are given our body, hair and skin by our parents, which we dare not damage." As a result, the Chinese people, men or women, avoided cutting their hair, and instead, they wound it into a bun or in various other hairstyles. Then, in the Qing dynasty, men were forced to shave the front of the head and to style the rest of their hair into a ponytail or plait. This hairstyle, known as the queue, was associated with loyalty to the emperor. People who failed to have such a hairstyle were seen as disloyal, and could be sentenced to death.
