The term is translated from the English word maker, which is derived from the fabrication laboratory project of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US. It is a consumer-centred project, emphasizing innovation and designed to empower individuals to develop and produce smart devices to suit personal needs. The students participating in the project are called "makers". In China, Chuangke refers to those who start their own businesses with innovative ideas. Chinese makers include tech-savvy people who dedicate themselves to creating new devices and distinguished innovators in various fields, such as software developers, artists and designers.

> 01、谷歌公司就什么人能在该公司取得成功这个问题做了多年的研究，研究关注的焦点不再是绩点、名牌大学、面试智力测验题。谷歌人力运营部高级副总裁拉斯洛博克认为，想取得成功，只拥有学历证书是不够的。博克指出，顶尖高校的毕业生可能缺少智力上的谦逊，并且学业上的成功并不意味着工作能力强。聪明的年轻学霸毕业生很少经历失败，他们会发现，在现实生活中，学业生涯并没有使自己做好大方接受失败的准备。谷歌认识到应聘者具有智力上的谦逊是十分重要的，他们所寻找的是一种能退一步思考、接受别人更好想法的能力。博克说他想寻找的首要素质就是常规的认知能力。那是一种学习的能力，是在繁忙的工作中处理信息的能力。

#### Exercise-1

> 01、The word rsum comes from the Latin curriculum vitae, which means "course of your life". It refers to a concise list of your work and educational achievements.
> 
> 02、A "hard sell" approach is normal in which the writer of the rsum tries very hard to persuade a potential employer that he / she should be interviewed or offered a job. This means the rsum is not a document that shows modesty or humility; rather, it stresses only very positive aspects of the job hunter.
> 
> 03、According to the passage, 26 per cent of British rsum writers are guilty of overdoing their rsums. That is, they tell lies.
>

> 01、This depends on the kind of job. If your family has a connection with a company or business, then you may be employed on the recommendation of a family friend. If you want to get a job as a civil servant, then you must pass the civil service entrance exam. Some students get information about jobs from a graduate job fair. They take their CV and talk to someone from the company and later they may be asked for an interview. For a position in a larger company, the process is similar to the Western process: You apply in response to an advertisement by sending your CV with a covering letter and then you might be invited for an interview.
> 
> 02、You should include your personal information, contact details, education and qualifications, details of work experience (even part-time jobs) and perhaps something about your skills and abilities.
> 
> 03、It should probably be one or two pages.

> 05、It depends on the job, but in general it is important to have a good positive attitude, to be willing to learn quickly, to have relevant skills and knowledge, and good communication and teamwork skills. Of course, if you have relevant work experience, this is helpful. If you have a good university background with good grades and good references from your teachers this also helps.

#### Exercise-4

> 01、一项申请弹性工作权利的新法律在英国正式生效。所有在申请日当天已为雇主连续工作满26周的员工都可以申请弹性工作。一项最新的研究表明，实行弹性工作制可以提高生产力，促进工作与生活之间的平衡，减轻企业员工的压力。研究结果显示，员工的工作效率在每天的早、晚达到高峰。在高峰时段完成的工作大多需要人们低头、保持安静和专注，如阅读、思考和通信。如果在该高峰时段能在家里工作，我们就能提高工作效率，把上下班高峰时段的通勤时间节省下来用于工作。所谓的理念经济正在侵蚀传统的朝九晚五、周一至周五的工作周模式。因为理念经济就在于创新，因此公司必须设法为员工提供灵活的工作方式，吸引、认可并奖励那些在后半夜或早上冲澡时产生奇思妙想的创新者，同时为员工提供空间，以便他们聚在一起时碰撞出思想的火花。

#### Exercise-5

> 01、According to statistics, the number of foreign students in China has been increasing rapidly in recent years, with about half of these students are pursuing a degree. While the majority of overseas Chinese students major in science and engineering, most foreign students in China study liberal arts subjects, among which law, Chinese and economics are their top preferences. Despite the fact that China has become one of the largest countries in hosting international students since 2010, international students only comprise about 1.6 per cent of the college students in China, which is below the world average. However, with the further development of China's economy, it is believed that the number of foreign students in China will be on the rise in the future.
