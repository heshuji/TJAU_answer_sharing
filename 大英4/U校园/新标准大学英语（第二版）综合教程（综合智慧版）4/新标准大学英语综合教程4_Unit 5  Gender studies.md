### 5-2 Active reading 2

#### Pre-reading activity-1

> 01、 Women may find that some male colleagues only look at them as women instead of competent workers. For example, the men may make personal remarks about a woman's appearance which they would not make about other men. Facilities for changing clothes or washing, and toilet facilities may not be suitable for women. Women may find that their contracts are not as good as men's contracts. For instance, they may have to work part-time or on short-term or temporary contracts. The women's pay may look the same as men's, but it is likely that there are more women among the lower-paid workers and fewer women among those with higher status or more senior jobs. Women may find it is difficult for them to get a promotion, although they may have similar qualifications, skills and experience as those men who do get promoted.

02、The way he talks about other people says something about his personality.
03、The way she behaves says nothing about her previous career.
04、This statement says a lot about the organization's attitude to women.
05、This type of task says something about the structure of the final examination.

#### Translatio-1

> 01、女权主义运动改变了人们使用英语的方式，它倡导使用非性别歧视语言和中性语言。例如，现在人们通常用Ms（女士）来称呼女性，因为与Mrs（夫人）或Miss（小姐）不同，用Ms可以避免提及她的婚姻状况。同样地，表示人类时，用humanity（人）而不是mankind（人类；男人）；当所指的人性别不明时，用他或她而不是他。一些作家，特别是在学术界，甚至开始用她来取代他，以此来消除一直以来阳性代词的使用所附带的性别歧视意味。同样地，使用那些用-man做后缀的词语，比如businessman（商人）和chairman（主席），也会出现一些问题，所以它们常常被businessperson和chairperson所取代。但有意思的是，在北美，通常大一新生不论男女都仍会被称作freshman，虽然有人提议用freshwoman来指代大一女生，但这一用法还没有得到广泛的接纳。

#### Translatio-2

> 01、In China, with the increasing improvement of women's social status and education level, more and more women are entering the field of high technology. A number of remarkable women scientists have distinguished themselves in every scientific field and made extraordinary achievements with their intelligence, ingenuity and love of science, acting as an important force in the social and economic development of China. In 2015, the Chinese woman pharmacologist Tu Youyou won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Being the first winner from our country of that prize in the field of natural science, she has greatly extended the influence of Chinese scientific research in the international community.

### 5-4 Reading across cultures

#### Text

#### Vocabulary

#### Exercise-1

> 01、A society which is controlled by men.
02、In New Zealand in 1893.
03、In the US in the 1960s.
04、Because millions of men were fighting abroad and there were fewer people to work in them. Women took the place of the men.
05、As theorists, they were interested in the feminist movement and women's rights, the removal of discrimination and harassment in the workplace.
06、They are all female heads of the government in their countries.

#### Exercise-2

> 01、Women in China did not have the vote before 1949.
02、This is a huge topic! I suppose the first thing to say is that compared to the male-dominated times before 1949, there has been huge progress in gaining equality. Since 1949 there have been strong policies and laws for women to have equal rights, and women can be educated and get employment in a whole range of jobs. This is basically a success story in China. Yes, outwardly in society there have certainly been huge transformations of women's roles, but what about inwardly in the family and in the real working lives of women? I am not sure, because since the economic reforms of the 1970s most women work, of course, but they still face some of the traditional gender divisions. For instance, they are expected to cook, clean and take care of their children. Women have multiple roles at work and at home, but many men do not seem to share the responsibilities at home. Yes, women do have to care for the children and increasingly for the elderly too. But today most people have access to kindergartens, which is a big help, and some working women get support from paid helpers at home. With the spread of wealth some rich men expect their wives to stay at home, which is a change in the other direction. Lots of rural women have gone to towns and cities to find work. That's a big change of role compared to working on collective farms before the 1980s.
03、First of all, we should say there is high participation by women in the workforce and women have lower-status jobs, which may mean that it is more difficult for them to get better jobs. Second, there is the big question of promotion: There are very few women leaders. However, I think this situation must have improved recently. Yes, but there are other problems for women at work. For instance, it is sometimes difficult for women to get proper maternity leave or to arrange flexible working hours so that they can manage their home and take care of children. "Women hold up half of the sky", but for some women the sky looks a bit cloudy and dark!
04、I think women can be successful in any career, if they want to. As we said before, there are difficulties for women to get better jobs and to get promotion to top positions, but it depends on how you look at it. Compared to many countries, China now has so many opportunities for women. Yes, in business, education and healthcare professions, services like finance industries or catering and tourism, women can clearly be successful. But most of the top leaders in most professions are male, so there is still progress to be made towards full equality at work.

### 5-5 Guided writing

#### Writing skills

#### Writing task-1

> 01、In one English study, both sexes were found to devote the same amount of conversation time to social topics; in another, the difference was found to be quite small.
02、As sport and leisure have been shown to occupy about ten per cent of conversation time, discussion of football could well account for the difference.
03、Despite these findings, the myth is still widely believed, particularly among males, that men spend their conversations "solving the world's problems".
04、Many of the jobs such as factory jobs which men had previously done, were taken over by women.
05、The movement was supported by a number of theorists, such as the Australian Germaine Greer, whose 1970 book The Female Eunuch rapidly became a best-seller.

#### Writing task-2

> 01、EU research has shown that seven per cent of women lose their jobs or are made to resign when they get pregnant.
02、UK research has found that, on average, women earn 85 per cent of a man's salary for a comparable job.
03、A US study has demonstrated that women are less likely to ask for a pay rise.
04、Various studies report that women who display ambition are seen as "too tough".
05、Research in Europe has revealed that discrimination in the workplace is experienced by 45 per cent of women.

#### Writing task-3
>01、The role of women in China has been greatly transformed in the last 60 years, from a somewhat submissive role in a male-dominated society to a position of strong legal equality and great progress. Historical and comparative studies show that women in China have made huge steps compared to the past or to women in other countries today. However, despite this huge progress it is still widely recognized that there are issues to be faced by women both at home and at work. Studies reveal that women have multiple roles as wage-earners and at home for cooking, cleaning and caring for children or the elderly. In their professional work, there is equality in the same pay for a comparable job, but some research demonstrates that the main issues are about promotion possibilities and about getting higher-status jobs. At the same time, many women take the initiative and become self-employed. Women from rural areas are going to towns and cities to find work: Often they become home helpers or go into small businesses in restaurants, cafs, market stalls and so on. As research confirms, these women represent the spirit of development in recent years to take the initiative and, as Americans say, "Go for it!"

#### Exercise-4

>01、在美国，很多女人对自己的身材不满，并为之感到苦恼。这一事实表明，这并不只是个私人问题，还是由西方文化的价值观引发的社会问题。女人们每天面对铺天盖地的商业广告，里面都是些瘦得不可思议却又曲线动人的模特儿。她们的美似乎是真实可及的，而且已经成为衡量魅力的标准。拿自己与那些身材完美的模特儿相比，女人们会给自己塑造一个负面的身材形象，以此促使自己节食减肥。然而，研究发现，人的体型更取决于基因，而非后天的自我控制。社会所提倡的理想身材对大多数女人来说都是难以企及的，这有害于她们的身心健康。整个社会应该认识到，塑造负面的身材形象是一种有害的紊乱症，需要、而且应该得到治疗。人们应该尊重自己的身体，用健康的食品、适度的锻炼、休息和娱乐来滋养它。我们应当鼓励女人欣赏自身独特、固有的美，不要再没完没了地执着于文化定义的美。

#### Exercise-5

> 01、China was traditionally a patriarchal society in which the idea of female inferiority had for long prohibited women's display of themselves. It was not until the founding of the People's Republic of China that we began to promote gender equality in its true sense. With sustainable economic development and all-round social progress, the government provided an equal opportunity for everyone to succeed in life, and women got sufficient protection of their rights and interests. For example, the resumption of the College Entrance Examination gave girls an equal opportunity to go to college; the Labour Law of China clearly stipulates that every citizen, male or female, is entitled to enjoy the same working rights. Nowadays gender equality has become a social consensus.
