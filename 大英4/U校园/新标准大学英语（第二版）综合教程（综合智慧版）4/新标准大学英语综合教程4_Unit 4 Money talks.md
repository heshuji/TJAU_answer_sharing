> 01、 I would spend most of it on food, I think. I could never seem to get enough to eat at that age. I ate a lot of sweets and pastries and knew all the best food shops in the neighbourhood. My pocket money would be all spent on books, as I was a complete bookworm. Other kids might buy toys and snacks, but all I wanted to do was escape into a book!

> 02、I guess the writer got the birthday present she wanted, for we can see that although they weren't wealthy (My easy-going father always looked unnaturally sombre when he was doing the bills.), she found a way to make some money (I worked out that if I found a job, something like a paper round, delivering early morning newspapers in the neighbourhood, I'd help pay some of the bills ). In this way, she could buy the present herself.

> 01、车库甩卖（在美国也称院子甩卖）是指人们出售不再需要的家居物品的非正式活动，比如家具、衣物、书籍、玩具等。出售地点通常是在家中，但出于隐私考虑，也为了更方便买家，物品会摆放在车库中或院子里。因为是非正式的，车库甩卖绝大部分是不受政府管制的，所以卖货者无须获取营业执照，也不用收消费税，只有一些地区需要一个许可证。车库甩卖通常会吸引大批的当地居民，因为他们有可能淘到物美价廉的用品。正因为如此，卖家需要在甩卖当天做好早起的准备，来应对许多早早前来搜罗便宜货、大买一番的买主。

#### Translatio-2

> 01、In recent years, with the development of the market economy in China, the level of development of our socio-cultural enterprises, as well as our science and technology and our productivity, has greatly increased, thus strengthening overall national power. The market economy also plays an enormous role in improving people's living standards and in fulfilling the goal of common prosperity. Compared with the early days of reform and opening up, substantial changes have taken place in Chinese people's spending habits and lifestyles, with consumption of basic food and clothing transformed gradually to consumption for pleasure, ushering in the consumption era. In turn, the pursuit of material wealth has also contributedtremendously to economic and social development.

> 
> 02、Each flower has some symbolic meaning, but there may be different interpretations. The orchid is a symbol of purity, grace, harmony and loyalty to the country. The lotus comes from the mud but is pure and upright, so it is a symbol of purity and beauty. The chrysanthemum is a flower of autumn, the soul of a cold autumn. It symbolizes long life and duration.
> 
> 03、The fifth series has six different banknotes and they all show Mao Zedong on the front. The one-yuan note shows an orchid (lan hua) and on the reverse side three pools which mirror the moon at the West Lake (三潭印月).

The ten-yuan note has a Chinese rose (yue ji) and the reverse side shows the kui men (夔门) on the Yangtze River. Then there's the 20-yuan note with a lotus (he hua) and on the reverse side the Lijiang River and scenery of Guilin. The 50-yuan note has a chrysanthemum (ju hua) and the reverse side shows the Potala Palace (布达拉宫) in Lhasa in the Tibet Autonomous Region. Finally, the 100-yuan note shows a Chinese plum (mei hua) and on the reverse the Great Hall of the People at Tian'anmen Square in Beijing. Older notes have some other designs; some show ethnic minorities.
> 
> 04、The orchid is a symbol of purity, grace, harmony and loyalty. The narcissus blooms around the New Year and is a symbol of good luck. The Chinese rose is a symbol of youth, the lotus of purity and beauty, the chrysanthemum of long life, and the Chinese plum of perseverance and good luck. The scenes on the reverse of the notes are all famous places in China, well-known scenic spots or places of interest.
> 
> 05、It's interesting that the world's first coins and the first paper money were developed in China. Cowry shells were used about 3,000 to 4,500 years ago and bronze coins began to be used in the Shang Dynasty (1600 BC1046 BC). They were made by pouring molten bronze into moulds and had different shapes: Some coins were spade-shaped, others were bell-shaped or knife-shaped. The flat surfaces were decorated with Chinese characters. The first emperor, Emperor Qin, introduced a round coin with a square hole in the middle, which allowed coins to be strung together. This became a national currency and the shape was used for 2,000 years. Then later in the 9th century paper money was developed in China. Merchants in the Song Dynasty used promissory notes known as "flying money" (feiqian) and in the Song, Yuan and early Ming dynasties, paper money was common. However, because of inflation this paper money was later abolished and not revived until the 19th century. Meanwhile, copper coins and silver taels were used. The modern currency, Renminbi has been used since 1948. There were notes with different designs in different editions and the fifth edition came out in 1999.

#### Writing task-3

> 01、When I started college, I managed my personal finances by making detailed budgets and keeping to them. In order to have enough money, I always put some money aside at the beginning of the month it's probably a good idea to save a little whenever you can. Sure, there are exceptions. On one occasion, I looked online to compare interest rates for savings accounts, and decided to make some other investments rather than save them that month. Besides the above experience, if you ask me, I really think there are some other ways that can help you manage your money. First of all, when it comes to looking after your personal finances, don't be afraid to ask someone experienced for their advice or to look online for help. Above all, don't forget to read all the terms and conditions before you sign anything concerning money. All these are my own experiences and advice, but if you want more advice later, you can get it by phoning the advice line at your bank and they will be happy to help you.

#### Writing task-4

> 01、When it comes to looking after one's personal finances, there are a number of points you should bear in mind if you don't want to have any unpleasant surprises later. First of all, you should avoid getting loans unless you know you can pay them back. Of course, you could take out a loan to cover the debt, but in view of the previous problem I don't think you should do that. Why not? Well, because if you get into further trouble, you'll need another loan to pay the first loan which was supposed to pay the debt, and all the loans will involve paying interest, so it will accumulate. You're better off getting a job and using the money to pay the debt. Secondly, when you are short of money, never borrow from a friend because it will ruin your friendship. I've borrowed quite a lot of money from a friend to pay the rent before, and it's not ended well. Money is hard to earn, but very easy to borrow. When it comes to money, it's always better to earn it than to get it any other way. Last but not least, you should be very cautious about using a credit card. There are a number of security precautions that you should take. On the one hand, before you sign any agreement, you should always read all of the terms and conditions carefully. There are lots of them and they're very boring, but it's essential that you know what you're getting yourself into. It's definitely a good idea to ask the bank staff lots of questions too, such as, "What happens if I miss a repayment?" On the other hand, make realistic budgets and follow them. Don't use the card without writing down the amount and keep looking at your record to see if you are approaching the credit limit. Whatever happens, don't exceed this limit because the bank will charge you interest.

#### Exercise-4

> 01、理财教育去年被纳入英格兰的国家课程，使英格兰与英国其他地方的教育相一致。英国人认为中、小学生需要具备在社会上处理财务的能力，包括像付房租和管理助学贷款这样的事情。既然孩子已经长大，能够理解金钱的重要性，就有必要让他们对信用与借贷有基本的了解。家长对孩子未来的理财能力也感到担忧。他们认为理财教育应该被纳为国家教育课程的一部分，甚至认为它比地理课还重要。但是超过一半的孩子更愿意从父母那里学习有关金钱的知识。家长需要特别注意的是，他们自己对金钱的感受会对孩子的金钱观和花钱习惯产生很大的影响。在家里谈钱是行之有效的方法，可以让孩子开始了解妥善理财的重要性。零花钱是一个很好的工具，家长可以用来教孩子挣钱和攒钱这一基本的生活技能。

#### Exercise-5

> 01、With the development of the Internet, online shopping has become incredibly popular in China and a preferred way of shopping, especially for young people. The "Double 11" Online Shopping Festival, which has emerged in recent years, provides a new opportunity for online retailers to prosper. The "Double 11" Online Shopping Festival originated in the massive online discount promotion by Taobao on 11 November 2009. Although the number of online businesses participating in it and the promotions were limited, the business turnover was far more than expected. The day was then set by online retailers as a yearly event for a massive sales promotion. Widely welcomed by online retailers and consumers, the "Double 11" is of great significance in boosting consumption and fuelling domestic demand.
